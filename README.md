# FreeFall
This code was developed for a university experiment. I apologize for any confusion; I had to learn Arduino programming quite suddenly. This code is available here for anyone who would like to help, modify, or use it if they wish. The components used, including the LCD, BTN, and others, will be added to the description later.
